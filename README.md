#SER316 FarmSimulator
This system simulates a farm collective with various farmers, animals, and means of making money.

##Initial Plans
I plan to go for the extra credit by having the design patterns work together. To me that sounds more intuitive than trying to split them up along with splitting the requirements.

I think the idea of using the Decorator pattern to give farmers and animals affinities is definitely the way to go.
I also plan to use the hint of using the factory pattern to create farms and possibly the farmers and animals as well depending on how complicated they end up being.
For the third design pattern I want to use the Facade to create the interface for the overall system. However my plans may change as the system evolves.

As for the cyclic pattern, my instinct is to have each turn cycle through one day and one night and on each turn the system will wait for the user to enter a move.
